# Premier League Tables

### Description:
A website built using Flask and connected to a Postgres Database that generates custom dated PL tables across multiple seasons from 1992 to the present.

This is my first fully functional full-stack project, so enjoy!

## Functionality

Using this website, user can generate customised Premier League Tables across. These tables can be generated per season, per calendar year and using cutom dates. Users can also generate tables that show the Premier Table during a particular manager's stint. All the current Premier League Managers are listed, as well as a selection of past Premier League Managers. Don't see your managerial choice? Contact me to add the manager to the list or enter the start and end dates during their time in charge
